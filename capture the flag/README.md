A beginner level CTF challenge

## Overview

The "c4ptur3-th3-fl4g" project is a simulated cybersecurity challenge designed to test and improve your penetration testing skills. Participants are tasked with proving their mettle as the most elite hacker in the solar system by overcoming a series of tasks. The scenario involves a hacker boasting about their skills in a bar, leading to a challenge by a group of Bounty Hunters to prove these claims. The challenge encompasses various stages, including Translation & Shifting, Spectrograms, Steganography, and Security through Obscurity.

## Usage Guide

### Task 1: Translation & Shifting

Translate, shift, and decode the following; Answers are all case-sensitive.

done
printf "$text"

```
10. LS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0g...LS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0=
```bash
    echo "--hash--" | base64 -d | morse -e - | xxd -b -c 1 | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/ //g' | tr '!-~' 'P-~!-O'
```

### Task 2: Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. 

1. Download the file

```bash
    sudo apt-get install audacity
    audacity `filename.wav`
```

Use a Spectrogram to visualize the flag.

### Task 3: Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

1. Decode the image to reveal the answer. 

    You can use this [Steganographic Decoder](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html). Upload the image and submit it to reveal the answer.

### Task 4: Security through Obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
```bash
    binwalk -C `filename`
    cd `_filename.extracted`
```

2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
```bash
    7z x `filename.rar`
    steghide --extract -sf `filename.png`
```
